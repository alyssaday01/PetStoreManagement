# Intro to Computer Science II: Project 3

## Coding Language: Java

This project was completed in an intro to computer science course in 2022.

The Pet Store Management System is a coding project that allows users to efficiently manage a pet store's operations. This project leverages object-oriented programming principles, including class inheritance, interfaces, array list manipulation, and specification classes to create a comprehensive system for managing different types of pets and store memberships.

## Key Components:

- Object Hierarchy: The system defines three main pet types: cats, dogs, and exotic pets, each represented by separate classes. These classes inherit common attributes and methods from a base pet class.

- Membership System: The system includes regular and premium member classes. Both classes implement an interface that defines member-specific operations such as member registration and member privileges.

- Driver Class: The central class, named "PetStore," serves as the entry point for users. It provides a menu-driven interface to access various functions and operations.

## Functions Available to the User:

- Buy a New Pet: Users can add new pets to the store's inventory by specifying the pet type (cat, dog, or exotic pet), its name, age, breed, and price. The pet will be stored in an ArrayList for future reference.

- Register a New Member: Users can register as regular or premium members, providing their personal information. Regular members can enjoy basic benefits, while premium members receive additional perks, such as discounts and priority access to adoption drives.

- Start Adoption Drive: The system allows for the initiation of adoption drives, where members can adopt pets at a discounted price. Regular members receive discounts, while premium members receive even greater discounts.

- View Inventory and Inventory Value: Users can view the entire inventory of pets in the store. Additionally, they can calculate the total value of the inventory, taking into account the prices of each pet.

- Compare Pet Prices: Users can compare the prices of different pets to make informed decisions before purchasing. The system provides information on the price of each pet type.

- Exit Option: Users can gracefully exit the system.

The system is designed to be user-friendly, ensuring that pet store operations are efficiently managed. It provides members with advantages and discounts to encourage engagement and enhance the overall experience. By employing inheritance, interfaces, ArrayList manipulation, and specification classes, the Pet Store Management System ensures modular, scalable, and maintainable code for a real-world pet store.
